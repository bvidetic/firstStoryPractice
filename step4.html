			<h1>He shoots, he scores.</h1>
				<p>Joey was excited to start step 4. This was the final step in his journey to become a hockey player as he 
				had learned all of the individual biomechanics needed to be the best.  In step 4 Joey learned to shoot 
				the wrist shot ahead, wrist shot across his body, backhand, goalie deek, screen, redirect, tip, snap and 
				slap shot.  The final day of class arrived and he scrimmaged in a full ice game. Joey was so excited and
				guess who came back to cheer him on; that's right, his grand parents.  Throughout the game, Joey did
				well. He skated around players with the puck; passed to his team mates and even scored a goal.  He was
				officially ready to play on a team. or so he thought. there was on last step that would complete his
				development experience and was learning to play the game; step5.</p>
