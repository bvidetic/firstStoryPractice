			<h1>Adapting to team skills.</h1>
				<p>By now, Joey developed a name for himself and was well know at Cool Kids Hockey Academy.  The kids in 
				step 2 couldn't keep up with him but step 3 was a big step up.  Joey noticed right away that most of the 
				kids could skate well and none struggled with the puck; once again he was a small fish in a big pond.  In
				step 3, Joey learned to pass the puck accross his body, pass ahead of him and behind him. Joey quickly
				learned to find open areas, call for the puck and receive the pass. Sometime he received the pass while
				standing still, other times he was skating at full speed.  Joey was so good, he was finding open ice,
				receiving passes and shooting the puck every chance he had. Unfortunately, Joey couldn't score on the
				tougher goalies. Although he had come a long way since step 1 he still needed work on his shot.</p>
