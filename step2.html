				<p>Step 2 was much different. Joey was skating very well but when he had the puck he slowed to a near stand still. In step 2 Joey learned how to skate with a hockey puck; how to appoach a defensive player and 
				manipulate him to create space. Joey learned to keep his feet moving and his head up when he got the
