			<h1>Learning to walk all over again, this time on ice.</h1>
				<p>To become a hockey player Joey had to practice many, many hours. His first practice started with learning to skate. He learned how to fall down and get up; how to walk on ice; how to skate on 1 foot then how to skate with both feet.</p>

				<p>The following weeek Joey reviewed the skills he learned the first day and also learned how to turn.
				The third week of class he reviewed skating and turning; then learned to stop. The forth week he reviewed turning and stopping; then learned and skate backwards. The fifth week he reviewed stopping and backwards; then learned to cross over. The sixth week he reviewed all of the skills and was excited to show off his skills in next weeks game.</p>
				<div>
				<p>Finally the big day arrived. Joey was ready to play in his first game!  His grandparents were there to 
				cheer him on.  Coach called his name for the first shift. During his first shift, a teammate passed the 
				puck to him at the blue line. He thought, I just need to skate to the net and shoot but before he finished his thought, a boy skated by, stole the puck and scored on his goalie. He quickly realized he needed to learn how to skate with a puck so he asked him mom to enroll him in step 2.</p>
