			<h1>Preparing for team play.</h1>
				<p>Joey knew this was the last step and couldn't wait to get started. He learned the basics of the game such as off side, icing, penalties and positioning. He learned how to defend his zone, break the puck out of his zone and into the opponents zone, how to set up around the defenders and how to score.  Naturally, Joey was one of the best players and was a natural fit for a travel level hockey team.</p>
